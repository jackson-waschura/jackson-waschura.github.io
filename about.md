Hi! My name is Jackson. I'm fascinated by machine learning and have spent the
last three years building, training, and deploying neural networks at
[Zoox](https://zoox.com/) to better understand the world around our autonomous
vehicle. I'm always searching to learn more about this alchemical art and find
new ways to put it to use. If you'd like to learn more about my profession
background, check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-waschura/).

In my free time I like to play board games, make cocktails, hike trails, and
try new food.

I'm currently looking to meet new people in the SF Bay Area passionate about
machine learning and life-long learning. If you think we'd have a stimulating
conversation, or if you have recommendations for any of the hobbies I listed
above, please reach out!
