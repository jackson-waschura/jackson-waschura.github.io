One of the most tragic feelings is believing there isn't much to do. Despite the long list of untouched games in my Steam library, the books I've bought but haven't read, and the notes filled with half-finished projects, I sometimes struggle to pick up any of them. I doubt I'm alone.
Many people experience this same hollow restlessness, this inability to exercise their own agency. The feeling is tragic precisely because it's false: life is so packed with worthwhile things that it can scarcely hold any more. And somehow, this truth is lost on us. Though this malaise isn’t new, the rise of AI may provide a compelling solution.

I thought about this recently after finishing *Bloodchild and Other Stories* by Octavia E. Butler. In an essay near the end of the collection, Butler describes her relationship with writing as a "positive obsession"—something she could not escape even if she tried.
That phrase made me wonder whether my blank stares at unread books and unplayed games mean I lack such an obsession. If so, what could be done? What can I do to best actualize my potential? With the right systems; could I manufacture success without the obsession?

During the last few years I’ve confirmed that my memory can’t be trusted to surface the things I care about. To compensate, I scatter cues everywhere—calendar events, to-do reminders, notebook lists. These crutches help, yet I still sense unused potential. I can identify the mental bottlenecks—how intentions decay, how attention drifts—but I lack the behavioral-design sense to turn that diagnosis into action. The gap is frustrating, but it also feels like an invitation: with the right tools, the distance between what I mean to do and what I actually do could shrink dramatically.

Artificial-intelligence research is progressing at a rapid clip. Within the next decade, specialized assistants and ever-larger generalist models will automate much of today's white-collar work. Consumer AI tools offering assistance, entertainment, and information will be everywhere. The question is no longer *whether* they will arrive, but **what we will do with them**.

It's easy to see how an AI coding agent could turn your idea into an actualized application, but is that really the bottleneck? Perhaps the real bottleneck is understanding what you want in the first place.

My hope is that we use AI to amplify—not replace—our agency. That doesn't just mean turning desires into finished products; it means helping us understand ourselves. Understanding our own goals, motivations, and values. Extending our memory and strengthening our sense of identity.

Think of it less as a genie and more as a friend who remembers what excites you. Imagine starting your day with a brief chat. Your assistant asks how you've been, then follows up on the side project you mentioned last week. You're quickly reminded of the enthusiasm that lit you up when the idea was fresh. Maybe you finish developing more of your ideas, maybe you come to understand that you actually don't want to do that after all and instead make plans to grab coffee with a friend you haven't seen in a while. What matters is that you've considered what you want.

If AI can nudge us toward the things that matter most to us, perhaps fewer great ideas will languish in notebooks and hard drives. The technology is on its way; the challenge is deciding how we want it to serve our passions rather than distract us from them.
