The following is a list of questions that I'm curious about. If you believe you
could share some insight about the answers, please let me know!

    1. What is the minimal amount of curation/adjustment necessary to avoid degredation / mode collapse when training on model-generated outputs?
    2. What are the highest-leverage applications of machine learning for accelerating science?
    3. How can we perform unsupervised object detection/discovery given large amounts of observational data?
    4. What is the best life system(s) for tracking and achieving your goals?
    5. How can we tokenize volumetric representations (NeRFs, splats, etc) as input to LLMs?
    6. How can we make self supervised methods (like JEPA, DINO, etc) more sample efficient?
    7. Why doesn't RL work without curricula? Can we fix it?
