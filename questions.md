The following is a list of questions that I'm curious about. If you believe you
could share some insight about the answers, please let me know!

  1. What are the highest-leverage applications of machine learning for accelerating science?
  2. How can we perform unsupervised object detection/discovery given large amounts of observational data?
  3. How can we tokenize volumetric representations (NeRFs, splats, etc) as input to LLMs?
  4. What are unique data sources or formats that people aren't yet feeding into LLMs?
